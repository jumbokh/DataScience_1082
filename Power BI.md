# Using Microsoft Power BI to Explore and Visualize Data #

[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/) was created to address the data explosion in commercial and academic organizations, the need to analyze that data, and the need for rich, interactive visuals to represent the data and reveal key insights. It contains a suite of tools that assist in the full life cycle of data analysis, from data discovery and collection to data transformation, aggregation, visualization, sharing, and collaboration. Moreover, it allows you to create rich visualizations without writing any code and present them in interactive dashboards.

Power BI can organize and unify all of your organizationâ€™s data to provide a clear, real-time view of your world. Its features include data connectors for a wide range of services and applications, support for popular file formats and databases, a full-featured expression engine, a WYSIWYG editor for creating sophisticated visualizations, support for visualizing data on the Web or on mobile devices running iOS, Android, or Windows, and support for embedding visualizations in your own Web or mobile apps.

    ![Entering SQL Server credentials](Images/portal-enter-credentials.png)

    _Entering SQL Server credentials_

1. Click the **hamburger** icon to open the side menu if it isn't already open, and confirm that a new item named "powerbilabs" appears in the menu under "Datasets."

	![The new dataset](Images/portal-new-dataset.png)
	
	_The new dataset_

You are now connected to an instance of the Adventure Works database hosted in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Now it's time to build a report that depicts some of the data in the database.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Create a data visualization ##

The heart of Power BI is the rich visualizations you can present to the user via dashboards and reports. In this exercise, you will create a report that shows data from one of the tables in the Adventure Works database.

1. Click **powerbilabs** in the side menu to open the dataset in the report designer.

	![Opening the powerbilabs dataset](Images/portal-open-dataset.png)
	
	_Opening the powerbilabs dataset_

1. In the report designer, click the **Table** icon in the "Visualizations" panel to add an empty table visualization to the workspace.

	![Adding a table visualization](Images/portal-new-table-viz-01.png)
	
	_Adding a table visualization_

1. To connect the table visualization to your data, click **Customers** in the "Fields" panel to display the fields in the database's Customers table.

	![Selecting the Customers table](Images/portal-select-customers-entity.png)
	
	_Selecting the Customers table_

1. Check **CompanyName**, **ContactName**, and **Phone** to add these fields to the table visualization.

	> You can resize the table visualization as desired by dragging the directional handles located around its edges.

	![Selecting fields in the Customers table](Images/portal-select-customer-fields-01.png)
	
	_Selecting fields in the Customers table_
	
1. To view your report visualization in interactive mode, click **Reading view**. If prompted to save your report, click **Save** and enter the name "Adventure Works" (without quotation marks).

	> In interactive mode, you can perform actions on your visualizations, such as sorting, grouping, and drilling down into other report elements. 

	![Switching to reading view](Images/portal-select-reading-view.png)
	
	_Switching to reading view_
	 
1. Click the arrow in the header of the CompanyName column to toggle the sort direction.

	![Toggling the sort direction](Images/portal-select-column-sort.png)
	
	_Toggling the sort direction_
	
1. Click **Edit report** in the top menu to exit interactive mode.  

	![Exiting interactive mode](Images/portal-select-edit-report.png)
	
	_Exiting interactive mode_
	
1. To change the fields displayed in the visualization, go to the "Fields" panel and uncheck all of the fields in the Customers table. Then click **Products by Category** to show the items underneath it, and check **CategoryName** and **ProductName**. Your table visualization will update with the selected values.

	![Changing the fields in the table visualization](Images/portal-select-product-fields-01.png)
	
	_Changing the fields in the table visualization_
	
1. Click **Save** in the top menu to save the report.

	![Saving your report](Images/portal-click-save-menu.png)
	
	_Saving your report_

Creating a report from a single table is easy: simply check the fields that you want to display in a visualization. You used a table visualization in this exercise, but there are lots of other visualizations to choose from. Feel free to try other visualizations and experiment with the different ways in which data can be visualized.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Add related data visualizations ##

Now that you know how to create a simple visualization, it's easy to add related visualizations as well as create visualizations of other types. In the previous exercise, you used a table visualization to depict product data. In this exercise, you will work with customer data using table visualizations and map visualizations.

1. Remove the existing table visualization by clicking the ellipsis (**...**) in the upper-right corner and clicking **Remove**.
	
	![Removing a visualization](Images/portal-remove-tiles.png)
	
	_Removing a visualization_
	
1. Click the **Table** icon in the "Visualizations" panel to add an empty table visualization to the workspace.
	
	![Adding a table visualization](Images/portal-new-table-viz-01.png)
	
	_Adding a table visualization_
	
1. In the "Fields" panel, check **CompanyName** and **Count of Rows** under Customers.
	
	![Selecting fields in the Customers table](Images/portal-select-customer-fields-02.png)
	
	_Selecting fields in the Customers table_
	
1. Click an empty area on the report designer surface to prepare the report designer to accept a new visualization.	 
	
1. Check **CustomerID**, **OrderID** and **Count of Rows** under Orders. Observe that the report designer automatically creates a new table visualization for you.
	
	![Selecting fields in the Orders table](Images/portal-select-order-fields-01.png)
	
	_Selecting fields in the Orders table_
	
1. Click an empty area on the report designer surface to prepare the report designer to accept a new visualization.

1. In the "Visualizations" panel, click the **Slicer** icon to add a slicer visualization. Then, in the "Fields" panel, check **CompanyName** under Customers. The slicer visualization will populate with a list of customers.

	> The purpose of a slicer is to narrow the portion of the dataset shown in other visualizations. Since both of your visualizations contain related data, Power BI automatically understands the relationships and responds to actions performed in related elements.

	![Adding a slicer visualization](Images/portal-adding-slicer-01.png)
	
	_Adding a slicer visualization_

1. To demonstrate how related visualizations interact, click **Around the Horn** in the slicer visualization and observe how the table visualizations update to show order information for the selected customer.

	> You can select multiple customers in the slicer by holding down the Ctrl key as you check the boxes for each customer.
	
	![Showing data for a specific customer](Images/portal-selecting-slicer-01.png)
	
	_Showing data for a specific customer_

1. Click **Around the Horn** again to uncheck it.

1. Up to this point in the exercise, you have been working with simple lists of data. To create more compelling visualizations, you can select a different type of visualization in the "Visualizations" panel. To demonstrate, begin by selecting the table visualization that shows Customer, CompanyName, and Count of Rows.

1. In the Customers section of the "Fields" panel, uncheck **CompanyName** and check **Country**.
	
	![Changing the fields displayed in a visualization](Images/portal-change-connected-fields-01.png)
	
	_Changing the fields displayed in a visualization_

1. In the "Visualizations" panel, click the **Map** icon and observe how the table visualization changes to an interactive map that includes proportionally sized map elements (the green circles) representing the number of customers in different countries. The customer counts come from the Count of Rows field. Now hover the mouse cursor over one of the green circles in the map to display a tooltip containing information about the number of customers in that country. 
	
	![Changing a table to a map](Images/portal-change-to-map.png)
	
	_Changing a table to a map_

1. Click **Save** in the top menu to save the changes to your report.
	
	![Saving your report](Images/portal-click-save-menu.png)
	
	_Saving your report_

The map visualization is a step in right direction toward creating richer visualizations, but your report is still somewhat plain. In the next exercise, you will use some of Power BI's report formatting options to add more flair.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
## Exercise 4: Enhance your visualizations ##

No matter how valuable and relevant your data may be, unless it's presented in a way that's easy to understand and visually appealing, consumers of that data will find it difficult to extract meaning from it. One of the most effective ways to grab a viewer's attention and present data in a meaningful way is to apply formatting and other enhancements to your visualizations. In this exercise, you will enhance the visualizations you have created in order to dress up your report.

1. Click the header of the slicer visualization to select the slicer.

	![Selecting the slicer](Images/portal-select-slicer-header.png)
	
	_Selecting the slicer_

<a name="Exercise5"></a>
## Exercise 5: Publish and share content ##

Power BI makes it easy to publish and share your content with users and groups of users, both internal and external to your organization. In this exercise, you will insert the report that you created in previous exercises into a dashboard and learn how to share that dashboard with other Power BI users. The you will see how Power BI's "Publish to Web" feature can be used to share content with external users.

1. Click **Pin Live Page** in the top menu of the Adventure Works dashboard.
	
	![Pinning a live page](Images/portal-select-pin-live-page.png)
	
	_Pinning a live page_
	
1. Select **New dashboard**, enter "Adventure Works" (without quotation marks) as the dashboard title, and click **Pin live**.
	
	![Creating a new dashboard](Images/portal-create-new-dashboard.png)
	
	_Creating a new dashboard_
	
1. Click **Adventure Works** in the "Dashboards" section of the side menu.

	![Selecting the Adventure Works dashboard](Images/portal-select-new-dashboard.png)
	
	_Selecting the Adventure Works dashboard_
	
1. Click **Share** in the upper-right corner of the dashboard.

	![Sharing the dashboard](Images/portal-select-share-icon.png)
	
	_Sharing the dashboard_
	
1. Type your Office 365 e-mail address â€” the one you logged into Power BI with â€” into the e-mail address box. Then click **Share** to e-mail yourself a link to the Adventure Works dashboard.

	> You are only sharing the dashboard with yourself, but realize that you can share the dashboard with any Power BI user by including the e-mail address that they use to access Power BI in the list of e-mail addresses that you enter.

	![Entering a list of recipients](Images/portal-enter-share-info.png)
	
	_Entering a list of recipients_

	![Copying the dashboard link](Images/portal-optional-share-info.png)
	
	_Copying the dashboard link_

1. Open a new browser tab or window and paste the dashboard link into the address bar to see how the dashboard will appear to users you share it with.

1. Sharing a dashboard this way limits its visibility to those you grant access to. However, Power BI also offers a "Publish to Web" feature that allows a report to be embedded in a public Web site or shared publicly through a URL. To demonstrate, return to the Power BI Services Portal and click **Adventure Works** in the "Reports" section of the side menu to open the report.

	![Opening the Adventure Works report](Images/portal-select-side-report.png)
	
	_Opening the Adventure Works report_
	
1. Click **File** in the menu in the upper-left corner of the report, and then click **Publish to web**.
		
	![Publishing to the Web](Images/portal-select-file-publish.png)
	
	_Publishing to the Web_
	
1. Click **Create embed code**.

	_Creating an embed code_
	
1. Click **Publish**.

	![Publishing the report](Images/portal-embed-warning-02.png)
	
	_Publishing the report_
	
1. The dialog that ensues contains two important values: a link that you can use to share the report with anyone (whether they're a Power BI user or not), and an IFRAME that you can paste into a Web page to embed the report in the page. Inspect these values, and then click **Close** to close the dialog.

	![Values for sharing a report publicly](Images/portal-embed-success.png)
	
	_Values for sharing a report publicly_

It's that simple to publish and share your Power BI content. If you are working with Power BI on a Windows computer, you can do even more by leveraging Power BI Desktop. If you are running Windows, proceed to Exercise 6. Otherwise, you are finished with this lab.


<a name="Exercise6"></a>
## Exercise 6: Do more with Power BI Desktop ##

The Power BI Services Portal is both flexible and robust, and since it runs in a browser, it can be accessed from any computer. But if you're a Windows user, you have an even more powerful tool at your disposal: [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/). It includes advanced features the portal does not, especially when it comes to query management, visualizations, and modeling. In this exercise, you will use Power BI Desktop to connect to a database, create a table visualization, and add a computed column to the visualization.

1. In the Power BI Services Portal, click the **Download** icon in the top-right corner and select **Power BI Desktop**. (Alternatively, you can point your browser to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/ and click the **Download** button there to download and install Power BI Desktop.) Follow the onscreen instructions to install Power BI Desktop on your computer.
